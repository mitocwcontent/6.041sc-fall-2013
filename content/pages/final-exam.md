Conclusion
----------

Congratulations! You've completed _Probabilistic Systems Analysis and Applied Probability_. You have learned all the basic tools of probability theory, the main concepts of statistical inference (both Bayesian and classical), and has been exposed to some classes of random processes. This is already enough to allow application of probabilistic methods to many real-world applications.

Further Study
-------------

For those wishing further study, there are the following possible directions:

*   A deeper study of the mathematical foundations of the subject, relying on measure theory \[[_6.436J Fundamentals of Probability_](/courses/6-436j-fundamentals-of-probability-fall-2018), [_18.175 Theory of Probability_](/courses/18-175-theory-of-probability-spring-2014/), _18.176 Stochastic Calculus_\]
*   Further classes on discrete random processes \[[_6.262 Discrete Stochastic Processes_](/courses/6-262-discrete-stochastic-processes-spring-2011/), _18.445 Introduction to Stochastic Processes_\] or random processes that evolve in continuous time over continuous state spaces \[[_15.070 Advanced Stochastic Processes_](/courses/15-070j-advanced-stochastic-processes-fall-2013)\]
*   Classes on statistics and inference \[[_15.097 Prediction: Machine Learning and Statistics_](/courses/15-097-prediction-machine-learning-and-statistics-spring-2012/), [_18.443 Statistics for Applications_](/courses/18-443-statistics-for-applications-fall-2003/)\] and associated algorithms \[_6.438 Algorithms for Inference_\]
